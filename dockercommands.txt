--> curl ifconfig.co (to know the public ip)


--> vi Dockerfile

--> docker images   --- to list the images

--> dcoker rmi imagesid    -- to delete the images

--> docker build -t jpets:${BUILD_NUMBER} Dockerfileloation

--> docker run -i -t imageid /bin/bash   -- to make a conainer

--> docker rmi ID --force  --- to delete forcefully

--> ip add | grep global     --- to get the ips

--> ctrl pq --- to exit safely from container

--> docker ps --- to see running container

--> docker ps -a   --- to see all the the exited ad running containers

--> docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash    -- to enter into the container

--> docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 --name newtom newtom:2.0

--> docker run -i -t imagename:version (if you dont want to map any port)

--> docker run --rm --name newtown -p 8080:8080 -d tomcatimage:1.0

--> docker run -it -p 8889:8080 -d imageid:tag /bin/bash ---> to run a image

      ---  here lefthand side ip i.e, 8889 is the machine ip and right hand side ip 8080 is the container ip(i.e, tomcat ip). In this case we are mapping tomcat container ip with machine avaiable ips.

--> docker start containerid  ---  to start the stopped container

-->  docker attach conatinerID --- to enter into the conatiner

--> docker container rm -f 6abe7d7e87a5 (to delete docker containers)

--> docker stop containerid

-->  docker commit ContainerID Newimagename:version (This is used for creating the new image from the existing container id)
     
      and re create new container with newly created image. so that we can map the port numbers....

How push the docker images to docker hub:-

How to push the docker images to nexus registry:-

----> docker login -u usrname -p password <nexus-hostname>:<repository-port>

----> docker tag <imageId or imageName> <nexus-hostname>:<repository-port>/<image>:<tag>

----> docker push <nexus-hostname>:<repository-port>/<image>:<tag>

----> docker pull saiboby/timage:2.0 (to pull images from private docker registry)
